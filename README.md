# Taylor_Maccoll_Supersonic_Cone

## How to Run

You'll need to download all the files in this repository, and make sure they are all in the same directory.  First download the GUI files, [GUI_Taylor_Maccoll.m](GUI_Taylor_Maccoll.m) and [GUI_Taylor_Maccoll.fig](GUI_Taylor_Maccoll.fig).  Next download the following function files (denoted by all caps): [THETA_BETA_M_v2.m](THETA_BETA_M_v2.m), [TM_EQUATIONS.m](TM_EQUATIONS.m), and [EVENTS.m](EVENTS.m).

Now all you need to do is run *GUI_Taylor_Maccoll.m*.
